# Overview

Homesteady is a web application designed to assist individuals in gardening and homesteading by providing actionable insights and resources tailored to their region. The app aims to make homesteading accessible to beginners and manageable for experienced users, bridging the gap between knowledge and implementation. As a software engineer, this project allowed me to explore full-stack development, user interaction, and API integration while building an app with real-world applications.

To start a test server on your computer, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the server with `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app's homepage.

This project serves to enhance my understanding of web development and deepen my knowledge of APIs, database management, and 3D modeling tools like Three.js.

# Web Pages

- **Homepage**: Introduces the app and provides a search bar for users to input their zip code. Dynamically displays weather and regional data upon submission.
- **3D Garden Page**: Provides an interactive 3D simulation of a customizable garden layout using Three.js. Users can add and modify garden elements based on recommendations.

Dynamic transitions occur through navigation links, and data refreshes dynamically without page reloads using React components.

# Development Environment

- **Development Tools**: 
  - **Visual Studio Code** for coding.
  - **Postman** for API testing.
  - **Node.js** with **Express** for backend development.
- **Programming Languages and Libraries**:
  - **JavaScript** for frontend and backend logic.
  - **Three.js** for 3D modeling.
