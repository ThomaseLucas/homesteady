      <h3>Book Genres</h3>
      <p>
        A genre is a category of literature, art, or music characterized by a particular style, form, or content. Genres help categorize books so that readers can find books they know they'll enjoy. Some authors specialize in writing in a specific style or genre. Once you find your author or genre that suits you best, you will never be able to put a book down from that genre.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are worried about having to read a whole book to understand what genere you like, don't worry, we can either summarize the book for you or give you a preview of the book. We also will give detailed descriptions of what each genre is about and what it presents to the reader.
